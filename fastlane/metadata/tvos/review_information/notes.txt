create a folder named jacob.eth inside of nft folder
created folder gets populated with files

the app uses com.apple.security.assets.music.read-write permisson to sync files into ".../music/nft folder" directory

"If your application manages libraries of pictures, music, or movies, the application may also write to the following directories:
~/Pictures/<app-identifier>
~/Music/<app-identifier>
~/Movies/<app-identifier>"

"where <app-identifier> is your application's bundle identifier, its name, or your companyâ€™s name. This must exactly match what is in App Store Connect for the application."

"nft folder" is my app's name, so it should work as app-identifier.
